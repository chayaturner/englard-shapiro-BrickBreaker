# englard-shapiro-BrickBreaker
Spring 2016 group project BRICK BREAKER 
(With added features by Kops and Turner)


BRICK BREAKER game
Goal: destroy all the bricks
How to play:
  - The ball will always move, the direction it moves will change when the ball has a collision (with a wall, paddle, or brick).
  - When a ball hits a brick the brick will disappear.
  - Your job is to use the right and left arrow key to move the paddle at the bottom to make sure the ball does not reach the floor.
  - If the ball goes below the paddle, you lose one of your 4 lives.
  - To take a break in the middle of the game use the P and R buttons respectively to pause and resume the game.
  
  New Features!
  -	Click the instructions button for more information during the game. (The game will pause for you to read).
  -	Some blocks contain special dropping pieces. Try to catch them to gain extra lives or grow your paddle length. Be careful though, there is also a shrinking paddle!
  -	When you complete the game, you will be able to move up levels! 
  	
  	
HAVE FUN!!
